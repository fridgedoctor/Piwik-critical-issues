# Piwik-critical-issues
Under system check/required PHP, Im told to make the following change to php.ini: always_populate_raw_post_data=-1, but only if your version is PHP 5.6. Changing PHP to 5.4. would eliminate the need for the aforementioned change. I checked with my web server and I was using 5.6, so i switched it back to PHP 5.4 and removed the "always_populate_raw_post_data=-1 from the PHP.ini file, refresh piwik Dashboard, and now i have a 500 server error? Details say, "The website encountered an error while retrieving http://www.example.com/analytics/index.php?module=CoreHome&amp;action=index&amp;idSite=1&amp;period=week&amp;date=2016-02-08" One interesting not,  If I am at the system check page and make these changes to PHP.ini, I will not get a server 500 error. The page will be nearly black except for the red PIWIK logo in upper left hand corner. So inorder for me to see anything in PIWIK version 2.15.0 im running, I need 5.6, which requires me to have "always_populate_raw_post_data=-1" in the php.ini file. The problem stems from the inability to view the map of my visitors
